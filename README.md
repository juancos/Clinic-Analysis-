Project Overview
This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to explore the intricate relationships between social media usage patterns and mental health outcomes. By applying K-means clustering, the project identifies distinct user groups based on their social media behavior and correlates these groups with various mental health metrics. The aim is to provide actionable insights that could guide interventions to improve digital well-being.

Features
Data Transformation: Convert non-numeric data about time spent on social media into quantitative measures.
Clustering: Use K-means clustering to categorize users based on usage and mental health data.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations that demonstrate cluster distributions and the characteristics of each cluster.
Repository Contents
Python Code: Scripts and Jupyter notebooks that contain all the data processing, analysis, and machine learning code.
Presentation: A PowerPoint presentation that outlines the project's objectives, methodology, key findings, and implications.
Comprehensive Report: A detailed report discussing the methodology, findings, and potential impacts of the study on policy and social media platform design.
Dataset Description
